DriverPass, led by Liam, the Owner, and Ian, the CIO, is set to create an online Learning Management System (LMS) alongside a scheduling tool for their services. This LMS will support users in preparing for their driver’s tests by offering customizable learning plans derived from various predefined packages. It will track users' progress and enable application owners to provide direct feedback. Furthermore, it will allow for updates to lesson plans as the source material evolves.

The accompanying scheduling component will facilitate the booking of one-on-one, in-person driving lessons. The core objective of this system is to bridge the existing gaps in DMV driver training and to address the high failure rates observed at the DMV. By providing both physical and virtual training options, the system is designed to help users build the skills necessary to pass their driving tests.

Reflecting on my work, if I had to select one area for improvement, it would be the Requirements and User Stories sections. Enhancing these sections with more detail, particularly regarding Technical Requirements, would lead to a clearer understanding of the project's needs and constraints. This improvement would help in better planning and execution.

Understanding user needs is crucial in system design because the final product must meet the users' expectations and requirements. Designing with the user in mind, rather than the developer’s preferences, is essential. Applying methods such as the 5 Why's can help uncover the fundamental causes of user needs, which in turn aids in refining the design process and creating a more effective solution.

In approaching software design, my focus is on comprehending user needs and simplifying their interaction with the system. Utilizing UML diagrams is a valuable technique for visually representing and analyzing these needs. This approach not only facilitates better review and refinement but also ensures that the system is both user-friendly and efficient.
